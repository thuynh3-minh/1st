Streanlit attempt. Streamlit is a Python library that allows interactive showcase of graphs and models. I will try to use Heroku for a cloud platform and build a webpage using streamlit. I will use the JHU database of covid19.
It is still under construction. I will probably use this to demonstrate the results of my research paper.
You can get access to the website at https://streamlit-one.herokuapp.com/
streamlit or jupyter voila???
